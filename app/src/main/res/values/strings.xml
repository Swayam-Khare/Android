        different case as follow: \n\nRed: The letter is not in the word.\n\nYellow: The letter is in the word but it is not at its correct place.\n\nGreen: The letter is in the word and it is at its correct place.\n\nYou get only 6 guesses to guess the word and each letter appear only once in a word.
